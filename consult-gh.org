*** Backend =consult-gh= functions
This section contains all the functions that are used by the front-end interactive commands organized by the category of items (e.g. branches, files, repos, issues, ...) or the =gh= commands (e.g. search) that they use.

Under each category we have sub-entries for different type of functions including but not limited to:
- *list function(s):* get a list of items (formatted as list of propertized strings to pass to =consult--read= or =consult--multi=)
- *action function(s):* that are used as action functions to be called on selected candidates
- *narrow function(s):* define how narrowing would work for the items in this category
- *state/preview function(s):* define how a state function to pass to =consult--read= or =consult--multi=, mainly to achieve previews.
- *group function(s):* define how items are grouped for each category. For example when looking at files, we want to group them by the name of the repo and the branch that is being viewed.
- *annotate function(s)*: define annotations for the items in each category for example for repositories we want annotations for the user, date and visibility, and for issues we want repo, status, tags and date

Other functions can also be defined under appropriate sub-entries depending on the needs for each category.

This is an internal function that takes REPO, the full name of

It fetches the preview from GitHub by “gh repo view REPO”

`consult-gh-preview-buffer-name' is used instead.

This is an internal function that takes REPO, the full name of a
repository \(e.g. “armindarvish/consult-gh”\) and ISSUE,
a issue number of that repository, and shows
the contents of the issue in an Emacs buffer.

It fetches the preview of the ISSUE by runing the command
“gh issue view ISSUE --repo REPO” using `consult-gh--call-process'
and put it as raw text in either BUFFER or if BUFFER is nil,
in a buffer named by `consult-gh-preview-buffer-name'.
If `consult-gh-issue-preview-major-mode' is non-nil, uses it as
major-mode, otherwise shows the raw text in \='fundamental-mode.

Description of Arguments:

  REPO    a string; the full name of the repository
  NUMBER  a string; issue id number
  BUFFER  a string; optional buffer name
  PREVIEW a boolean; whether to load reduced preview
  TITLE   a string; an optional title string

  "Open the pull request with id NUMBER in REPO in BUFFER.

This is an internal function that takes REPO, the full name of a repository
\(e.g. “armindarvish/consult-gh”\) and NUMBER, a pr number of REPO,
and shows the contents of the pull request in an Emacs buffer.

It fetches the details of the pull request by calling
`consult-gh--pr-read-json' and parses and formats it in markdown syntax,
and puts it in either BUFFER, or if BUFFER is nil, in a buffer named by
`consult-gh-preview-buffer-name'.  If `consult-gh-issue-preview-major-mode'
is non-nil, uses it as major-mode for BUFFER, otherwise shows the raw text
in \='text-mode.

Description of Arguments:

  REPO    a string; the full name of the repository
  NUMBER  a string; pull request id number
  BUFFER  a string; optional buffer name
  PREVIEW a boolean; whether to load reduced preview
  TITLE   a string; an optional title string

`consult-gh--pr-view-action'."

(defun consult-gh-issue-list (&optional initial noaction prompt)
  "Interactively list issues of a GitHub repository.

This is an interactive wrapper function around `consult-gh--async-issue-list'.
With prefix ARG, first search for a repo using `consult-gh-search-repos',
then list issues of that selected repo with `consult-gh--async-issue-list'.

It queries the user to enter the full name of a GitHub repository in the
minibuffer \(expected format is “OWNER/REPO”\), then fetches the list of
issues of that repository and present them as a minibuffer completion
table for selection.  The list of candidates in the completion table are
dynamically updated as the user changes the minibuffer input.

Upon selection of a candidate either
 - if NOACTION is non-nil candidate is returned.
 - if NOACTION is nil     candidate is passed to `consult-gh-issue-action'.

Additional command line arguments can be passed in the minibuffer input
by typing `--` followed by command line arguments.
For example the user can enter the following in the minibuffer:
armindarvish/consult-gh -- -L 100
and the async process will run
“gh issue list --repo armindarvish/consult-gh -L 100”, which sets the limit
for the maximum number of results to 100.

User selection is tracked in `consult-gh--known-repos-list' for quick
access in the future \(added to future history list\) in future calls.

INITIAL is an optional arg for the initial input in the minibuffer.
\(passed as INITITAL to `consult-gh--async-issue-list'\).

If PROMPT is non-nil, use it as the query prompt.

and the official manual of consult, here:

It queries the user for a search term in the minibuffer, then fetches the

For example the user can enter the following in the minibuffer:
